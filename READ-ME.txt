DoWLS-MAN
Database of Word-level Statistics (Mandarin)
authors: Karl David Neergaard, Hongzhi Xu, James Sneed German, Chu-Ren Huang

This database provides lexical characteristics of a descriptive and statistical nature 
for words and nonwords of Mandarin Chinese. The article describing this database 
(Neergaard et al., 2021) can be found at https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01620-7.
Meanwhile, the website that provides an interface to the database can be found at https://dowls.site/.
The syllable inventory that the database is built on was created in Neergaard & Huang (2019).

The database is designed for researchers particularly concerned with language processing 
of isolated words.  The database is divided into 32 files, separated according to the 
segmentation schema (8 tonal and 8 nontonal) used to calculate phonological similarity 
between words. Half of the files are for words, the other half nonwords. Each file consists 
of invariant and variant lexical characteristics

Tonal segmentation schemas: C_G_V_C_T, C_G_V_X_T, C_V_C_T, C_G_VX_T, C_GVX_T, CG_V_X_T, CG_VX_T, CGVX_T

Non-tonal segmentation schemas: C_G_V_C, C_G_V_X, C_V_C, C_G_VX, C_GVX, CG_V_X, CG_VX, CGVX

*** Segmentation is done by adding blank spaces between units ***
Examples per each segmentation schema with the syllable: 
xiao3/ɕiaʊ3/(小) & xian4/ɕiɛn4/(线)

Invariant lexical characteristics

Key: Searchable phonological word without spaces, i.e., sampa without spaces 
(unsegmented) of phonological words. Segmented versions of the same sampa can be 
found for each of the schemas under Pho_T or Pho_NoT below.

PY_T: Pinyin with tone

PY_NoT: Pinyin without tone

IPA_T: IPA with tone

IPA_NoT: IPA without tone

Onset: Item onset according to sampa dictionary below

Tone: Lexical tone number/s

SyStruct: Syllable structure according to the CGVX system

SyLen: Syllable length

PyLen: Pinyin length

Dom_POS: Dominant part of speech (POS)

Freq_Dom_POS: Frequency of the dominant POS

Percent_Dom_POS: The percent that the Dom_POS represents "Key_T" in comparison to 
other POS assignments for the same "Key_T"

Other_POSes: The other parts of speech assignments that were not of the highest percentage

_______________________________
Variant lexical characteristics

Pho_T: Tonal segmented phonological word, i.e., the phonological word as represented in sampa,
segmented according to a segmentation schema. The unsegmented version of this column is 
either Key_T.

Pho_NoT: Non-tonal segmented phonological word, i.e., the phonological word as represented 
in sampa, segmented according to a segmentation schema. The unsegmented version of this column 
is Key_NoT.

PhoLen: Phoneme length, i.e., the number of units within the item after being 
segmented according to one of the 16 segmentation schemas

FreqDowls: Raw subtitle movie corpus lexical frequency for each phonological word seen in 
Key. 

FreqDL: Log10 transformation of FreqDowls

Homophones: Simplified Chinese character/s that correspond to the phonological word 
presented in Key

HD: Homophone density, i.e., the number of words that share the same pronunciation 
as seen in Pho_T for tonal files and Pho_NoT for non-tonal files

PND: Phonological neighborhood density, i.e., The total number of phonological 
neighbors after calculating the replacement, addition, and subtraction of a segment 
between the target word and the top 30,000 most frequent phonological words

Sub_PND: Substitution neighbors, i.e., the number of substitution neighbors between the 
target word and the top 30,000 most frequent phonological words

Add_PND: Addition neighbors, i.e., the number of addition neighbors between the target 
word and the top 30,000 most frequent phonological words

Del_PND: Deletion neighbors, i.e., the number of deletion neighbors between the 
target word and the top 30,000 most frequent phonological words

Neighbors: All phonological neighbors presented in sampa

NF: Neighborhood frequency, i.e., the mean frequency of all of the 
phonological neighbors seen in Neighbors

CC: Clustering coefficient, i.e., the ratio of neighbors that are neighbors of each other
as measured through the igraph R function for local transitivity()

CS: Component size, i.e., the number of nodes within the component a word resides in

Btw: Betweenness centrality, i.e., the number of times a given node is a bridge between the shortest paths of two other nodes as measured through the igraph R function betweenness()

Close: Closeness centrality, i.e., the average shortest path length between a given node and all other nodes within its component as measured through the igraph R function closeness()

Eigen: Eigenvector centrality, i.e., the relative influence of nodes based on the influence of its neighbors, such that a node with high Eigen is connected to many nodes that have high Eigen. Eigen was measured through the igraph R function centr_eigen()

Notes on the word list

The original frequency counts are adapted from the word list of Subtlex-CH (Cai & Brysbaert, 
2010).

_______________________________
Notes on the nonword list

The nonword items include four classes as labelled in the Lexicality column: "added", "tonegap", 
"syllablegap", and "systemicgap". Added items are existing syllables that correspond to a Chinese 
character but were not items featured in the Subtlex-CH wordlist. These items were added to the 
list in order to provide statistical information for all Mandarin syllables. They were however 
given a frequency count of 0 and accordingly do not contribute to measures of phonological 
neighborhoods.Tone gap nonwords are items whose syllables exist in the Mandarin syllable inventory 
but whose tone assignment does not correspond to a Chinese character. Syllable gap nonwords are 
items whose syllables do not exist in the Mandarin syllable inventory that were constructed through 
choosing biphone combinations that do exist in the inventory. Systemic gap nonwords are items that 
comprise biphone combinations that do not exist in the Mandarin syllable inventory.
